# ARCHIVE NOTE
This repository has been archived, effective as of May 18th, 2023. I don't use Laravel a lot for blogging purposes as it is exhausting to manage and quite expensive to serve. The newest blog repository has been moved to https://github.com/NikarashiHatsu/nikarashihatsu.github.io. Consider checking it out to learn how to set up one for your own.

I've set up a better workflow to deploy and compile the code using GitHub Pages. Consider checking out the GitHub workflow folder for more information.
