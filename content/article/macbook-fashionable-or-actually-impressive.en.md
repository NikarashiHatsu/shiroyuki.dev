The words of description above are insults thrown at me by my friends and even
some of my family members. They say things like, "Why did you buy such an
expensive laptop? It's just for coding anyway."

My initial reaction was anger, and I now tend to avoid people who say such
things. To others, a laptop may only be a device that supports the needs of
office workers, students, or heavy gamers.

My reason for being upset is understandable because my main use for the laptop
is for work. As a programmer, a Personal Computer, whether it's a laptop,
desktop, or AIO, will be used fully from morning to night (even 24 hours if
there is a deadline).

But the fact that I spent a significant amount of money on a MacBook can't be
denied, and I carry this laptop in my bag every day, so however angry I may be,
I have to accept it.

Although it was a blind buy at first, after a year of using it, I feel a very
big difference in several aspects compared to a normal laptop. The reasons are
varied.

## Load Time

"Load Time" refers to how long it takes for a device to complete a task. For
example, when opening a browser, such as Google Chrome, we wait a few seconds
after clicking the browser icon. The amount of time we wait for Google Chrome to
open is called the Load Time.

The same goes for games, whether it's opening a new area, transitioning to a
room, or before fighting the final boss, there will be a loading time before we
can carry out our next activity.

Of course, coding also requires a fast Load Time. I've heard some complaints
from other programmer friends, even fellow computer engineering students:

> You know, I wait so long for loading, I can eat or snack while waiting. Or
> even have a poo. It's so slow! 🤦‍♂️

Or even worse:

> Ghits, I once waited for Flutter to install, it was so slow, I started playing
> with my phone while waiting. But when I was playing with my phone, I lost
> track of time and suddenly it was night.

Wow. But in this case, we can't entirely blame the Load Time, because the main
cause of slow Load Time is the inability of the processor or RAM to process and
allocate data received. Of course, the speed of the HDD / SSD also matters.

I personally have experience benchmarking my MacBook Pro M1 2020 with my old
ASUS X441UV laptop. To open a Flutter project, until it's running, the Load Time
difference is drastic.

| Device | Running Time |
| ------ | ------------ |
| MacBook Pro M1 2020 | 24s |
| ASUS X441UV | 1m 12s |

So, in conclusion, by eliminating Load Time, we as developers can focus on other
more important things, such as thinking about the logic of the system being
built. Eliminating Load Time also results in longer productive time.

## Battery Life

Basically, laptops can be taken anywhere without worrying about not having an
electrical outlet. The main problem with laptops now is battery issues. Laptops
in general have a battery cycle that will decrease with usage. In my case with
my ASUS laptop, the laptop could last without charging in the first year. The
second year, it began to drop, and had to be charged to full capacity in the
third month.

There are three options I can do:
1. The cheapest option, keep it plugged in, the risk is if it is suddenly disconnected or the power goes out.
1. Rather-expensive option, replace the battery.
1. The expensive option, replace the laptop.

At that time, as a high school student, I did not have the money to buy a
battery. So I took the first option. Actually, the risk is high, if during a
Windows Update, the power is disconnected, there is a possibility that the
Windows will become corrupted. Or while gaming or designing, there is a
possibility that the progress data will be lost.

Today, when this blog is written, my MacBook is over 1 year old, and its battery
life is still at 87%. It can still survive a full day under heavy workload.

Battery health from 100% to 87% in one year is considered wasteful due to a
small mistake I made, I installed the Intel version of VSCode while my MacBook
uses the ARM architecture. Of course, at that time, there was a battery drain
from 100% to 20% in 2 hours. Very wasteful.

## Performance

Who would have thought that Apple Silicon could surpass the performance of the
latest and strongest Intel processors? According to [Techjourneyman](https://techjourneyman.com/blog/apple-silicon-evolution-vs-intel-and-amd/), when the
Apple Silicon M1 was released, it outperformed the best generation 10 Intel
processor (i9-10980HK), forcing Intel to fight back.

Of course, Intel beat M1 with the release of the i9-11900K, but was completely
defeated by the M1 Max and M1 Ultra. In terms of performance and integrated GPU,
M1 is far ahead of Intel, who relies on external GPUs like Nvidia.

"With such great performance and power, what about battery usage, is it
wasteful?" No, because the M1 architecture is ARM-based, focusing on the balance
between processor size, lower power consumption, lower heat, speed, and longer
battery life. Unlike processors with x86 architecture, which optimize
performance but consume a lot of power.

## Disadvantages

It's not fair if I only state the advantages of the MacBook while not mentioning
its disadvantages. Of course, these things I felt have a significant impact on
me:

1. A steep learning curve. As a new MacBook user, MacOS has many features that
   rely on shortcuts if you want to work faster. Moreover, the difference in UI
   from Windows to MacOS is very different.

1. Not modular, once you buy a MacBook, there are no options to upgrade it in
   terms of storage, RAM, or processor. Yes, all components are soldered to the
   motherboard.

1. Windows applications cannot be installed on MacOS. Although some developers
   can bring their applications to MacOS, most cannot be installed just like
   that. The solution is, you can use the web version of the application or
   install it on a virtual machine like Parallels.

1. Features that have been available on Windows for a long time are not yet
   available on MacOS. A feature that I often need on Windows is the volume
   mixer. A simple software aimed at adjusting the sound of each application is
   not provided on MacOS. Whether in the development stage, or Apple
   deliberately does not make it.

1. Capitalism at its best. Many paid programs are overpriced, even for extending
   iCloud storage, we have to pay a subscription. Every Apple built-in feature
   such as Music, TV, Podcasts is all paid.

1. Ports. MacBook releases in 2020 and above, with the 13-inch series, do not
   have enough ports for everyday needs. Only 2 thunderbolt type C ports are
   provided by Apple, and there are no other ports. So I have to buy a dongle,
   which is not cheap either.

## Last words

Aside from the luxurious presentation of the Apple logo, there are many
advantages to the MacBook that I have experienced. But is the MacBook "worth to
buy"? Honestly, no. Personally, I prefer Linux, with its optimized performance
(although complicated), you can get performance comparable to a MacBook or even
better by using Linux without spending tens of millions of budgets.

I can even say that my ASUS X441UV laptop almost reached the performance of the
MacBook M1 for basic daily usage when using Arch Linux. So, for those of you who
want to buy Apple products, reconsider your budget, okay 😬.
